What is EHS Research?

Research about EHS or Emergency Health Systems is good because recent exposure to volunteer first responder organizations, such as St. John Ambulance (SJA) and the Canadian Red Cross (CRC), has highlighted meaningful variation in how training, equipment, and documentation systems support care delivery in prehospital settings. Settings like these raise a good question: how can systems like the Patient Care Record (PCR) and the medical bag be improved for volunteer first responders in order to make good decisions in the field? Field considerations can start with the PCR project.

PCR Project

Patient care record (PCR) project is good because first responders in volunteer emergency organizations often document patient information using paper-based PCRs. Paper-based PCRs are critical for care continuity, yet they are difficult to complete in real-world conditions such as poor lighting, bad weather, or during high-stress calls with limited personnel. Personnel that will take on this project will explore how a PCR system - whether paper-based, digital, or hybrid - can be improved for greater usability, speed, and accuracy in such environments. In such environments, the goal is to prototype a tool that aligns with field workflows, responder skill levels, and situational constraints, informed by real use cases and validated through mock scenarios and real life testing. Testing of this system can be associated with the medical bag project.

Medical Bag Project

Medical bag project is good because first responders in volunteer organizations carry medical bags into unpredictable environments - from residential buildings to outdoor disaster sites. Sites like these demand that the medical bags be portable, field-friendly, and allow fast access to critical equipment during treatment. During treatment, the current designs can be cumbersome, poorly organized, and contribute to responder fatigue or strain. Responder fatigue or strain are two problems that this project seeks to decrease by improving the medical bags in volunteer first responder organizations in order to improve usability, ergonomics, navigability, and responder safety while maintaining simplicity and adaptability. Adaptability of the contributors will be tested as they explore layout optimizations, modular organization, and potentially lightweight or weather-resistant materials. Materials of the prototype should reflect realistic workflows and environmental challenges with metrics like speed and comfort for these systems.

These systems have a lot of gains to offer, including insights into how documentation and equipment impact responder performance and patient care, identification of barriers that decrease usability, including consistency and safety in emergencies. Emergencies require the solutions to be scalable, user-focused, and aligned with emergency services. Services and their priorities in alignment with academic collaborations are the next step in order to observe and pilot small-scale initiatives and improve EHS research.

What are the EHS Research requirements?

The EHS research requirements are important in order to know the scope of the research and to determine the baseline expectations of the people who will work on the research associated with the PCR project and the medical bag project, and therefore let us detail the following requirements of the PCR project:

PCR Project

- PCR project design comparison across SJA and CRC responders.
- Responder alignment with the PCR form based on their skill level.
- Level up the design for non-ideal field conditions, such as mass casualties and low light.
- Light integration with digital, voice, and diagnostic tools.
- Diagnostic tools interoperability for real-time data capture and automated feedback.
- Feedback generation, such as underlying trends, quality assurance and prevention.
- Prevention of responder fatigue and sleep levels on PCR accuracy and workflow.
- Workflow simulation of PCR in varied scenarios to improve retention and field readiness.
- Readiness of the PCR in association with the medical bag project.

Medical Bag Project

- Medical bag project design comparisons across SJA and CRC responders.
- Respondersâ€™ performance in terms of efficiency, portability, and ergonomic safety.
- Safety, including navigability, simplicity, and customizability based on responder level.
- Level up integration of systems, such as vision-and-voice-based item tracking.
- Tracking hygiene considerations in hazardous or high-contamination environments.
- Environments consideration and collaboration with logistics teams inventory setup.

The setup of the projects in the EHS research can be guided by the initial requirements that are detailed above in order to start the process of generating prototypes that satisfy the goals of the projects. The projects can be taken on by people and teams in a way that deviates from the aforementioned requirements while ensuring that there is an improvement in the current state of the art.

What is EMT Research?

Emergency Music Therapy (EMT) research explores how music can help people achieve a balanced emotional and cognitive state during stressful or overwhelming situations. In volunteer response environments and wellness spaces, individuals may feel anxious, fatigued, or disconnected. Music offers a flexible way to support wellbeing by helping people calm down, refocus, or restore energy depending on their needs. Research shows that music can have powerful effects on the brain and body: familiar songs have helped some regain awareness, stroke survivors have recovered speech through rhythmic exercises, and responders have used music to restore alertness during fatigue. These examples raise an important question: How can music-based activities be used in emergency and wellness settings to help individuals regulate their emotions, restore energy, and return to a more balanced mental and physical state?

Music Sessions Project

The Music Sessions Project designs and tests volunteer-led music activities in emergency and wellness settings, such as rest centers, preparedness events, and volunteer wellness breaks. Sessions may include calming melodies for stress relief, rhythmic beats for energy, or familiar tunes for grounding. The goal is to create simple, scalable session formats that volunteers can deliver across diverse contexts.

Music Partner Project

The Music Partner Project focuses on collaborating with community musicians, educators, and wellness practitioners to strengthen EMT initiatives. These partnerships provide training for volunteers, share best practices, and integrate evidence-informed techniques. By leveraging community expertise, EMT sessions can become more inclusive, adaptive, and effective in supporting diverse needs.

The next step is to define the requirements for testing and implementation, which will guide pilot activities, training, and evaluation. By establishing a structured approach, EMT research can deliver meaningful gains, including better emotional regulation, improved focus, increased volunteer engagement, and stronger community connections. These benefits will inform future prototypes and help integrate music-based strategies into broader wellness and emergency response programs.
